## Woof Woof Dogs Page - React project

The brief was to build a full-stack application with a React front-end and noSQL database. The application had to include data schema and a RESTful api framework.

The application is deployed via Git on Heroku and can be found here: [Cabin Fever](https://cabin-fever.herokuapp.com).


This was a pair-coding, hackathon project at General Assembly.

The brief was to:

Consume a publicly available API
Deliver the data back in a React app
The project consumes data from Thedogapi API.

The site can be run locally by cloning the repository and typing npm i and then npm run serve in the terminal.
