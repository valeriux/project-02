## Woof Woof Dogs Page - React project

This was a pair-coding, hackathon project at General Assembly.

The brief was to:

Consume a publicly available API
Deliver the data back in a React app
The project consumes data from Thedogapi API.

The site can be run locally by cloning the repository and typing npm i and then npm run serve in the terminal.
