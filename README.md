## Woof Woof Dogs Page - React project

This was a pair-coding, hackathon project at General Assembly.

The brief was to:

* Consume a publicly available API and it was Thedogapi API.
* Deliver the data back in a React app

## Installation

* The site can be run locally by cloning the repository and typing npm i and then npm run serve in the terminal.

## App overview

* The application allows a user to search for a dog breed, returning the results under the search input. You can choose the breed or write. In order to implement the search we use react-select.
